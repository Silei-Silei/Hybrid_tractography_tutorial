Hybrid Orientation Evaluation
===================================

Comparison of Hybrid Orientation with other fibre orientation reconstruction method
--------

First, a comparison to the Ball and Stick model (BAS)

Tractography
--------
Global fibre tractography was achieved using the iFOD2 algorithm. Fibre bundle segmentation was performed with inclusion and exclusion masks from XTRACT to extract 42 tracts spanning the whole brain, including association, commissural, limbic and projection fibres48. The masks were warped from standard (F99) space to the BigMac diffusion data.(https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/XTRACT)
